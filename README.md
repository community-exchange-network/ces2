# Community Exchange System (CES 2)

## About the Community Exchange System

The Community Exchange System (CES) is the world's foremost moneyless exchange platform, enabling communities to trade goods and services without conventional money. Since its launch in 2002, CES has grown to include over 1,000 exchange groups across more than 100 countries, creating a global network for community-based alternative economics.

CES operates as a trust-based system that allows members to trade with each other using community currency. Unlike traditional monetary systems, CES emphasises human relationships and local exchange, creating a foundation for a more equitable and connected society.

## The CES 2 Project

CES 2 is a full-stack, open-source upgrade of the Community Exchange System, empowering thousands of communities in over 100 countries to trade without money. 

This repository contains the code and documentation for CES 2, a complete open-source modernisation of the original Community Exchange System platform. After more than two decades of operation, we're upgrading the entire system with modern technologies to support greater adoption, better usability, and enhanced features (building a faster, mobile-first platform).

### Project Goals

- Create a modern, mobile-first application for community exchange
- Simplify the user experience to enable mass adoption
- Support local communities while maintaining global connectivity
- Reduce the maintenance burden on the core team
- Ensure the system reflects our values of trust, community, and non-monetary exchange
- Safeguard the communities that depend on CES by opening the code.

### Technical Foundation

CES 2.0 builds on Komunitin, an open-source community exchange platform that evolved from IntegralCES (itself a fork of the original CES). We've chosen to adopt Komunitin as our foundation because of its modern architecture and alignment with our values.

#### Key Technologies

- Frontend: TypeScript, Vue.js
- Backend: TypeScript, Go for notification services
- Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL
- Infrastructure: Redis, Docker
- Mobile: Native app with NFC and QR code support

## Project Status

CES 2.0 is currently in the feature definition and planning phase. We're working to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that captures the essential functionality of community exchange while implementing a modern, user-friendly interface.

We aim to release a beta version in Q3 2025, with additional features rolling out through 2025-2026.
